        <p><span class="first-character sc">H</span>i, my name is Arnav Govil! During my free time, I like to work on various coding projects, find and cook yummy recipes, and play video games. Among the three, I am most passionate about coding- it helps me improve my problem-solving skills, cultivate my creativity, and explore innovative solutions to intricate problems. 
        </p>
        <p class="line-break margin-top-10"></p>
        <p class="margin-top-10">I began coding when I was about eight years old when I joined a robotics club. I continued in the club until I was about ten years old once I learned the basics of various programming languages such as Python, Java, and C#. After taking a year-long break from coding, quarantine occurred and out of boredom, I began picking it up again from old Python projects I had previously created, teaching myself by attempting to reverse-engineer what I had coded. As quarantine continued, I proceeded with school online, which allowed me plenty of time to finish my schoolwork and code more on the projects I was working on. Eventually, when I felt I had worked on enough of Python, I re-learned other programming languages and software such as Java, C#, Unity, Arduino, and now HTML and CSS to code this website!

      <h2>Skills of a Good Leader</h2>
    </div>
</section>

<section>
    <div class="block">
      <p><span class="first-characterLe ny">G</span>ood leaders possess many essential skills. In this section, I will explore the five key leadership skills that contribute to crafting an effective leader.
      </p>
      <p class="line-break margin-top-10"></p>
      <h4 class="margin-top-10">1. Communication</h4>
      <p>Clear communication is crucial to get ideas flowing and actions thoroughly executed. A leader must be able to have this skill to make sure everyone understands what is happening. Strong communication also builds trust, a vital element every team should strive to have.
      </p>
      <h4 class="margin-top-10">2. Integrity</h4>
      <p>Integrity means encompassing honesty, transparency, and accountability for your actions, forming trust and dynamic collaboration. A leader needs this skill, as it fosters a sense of reliability and inspires others to uphold similar values, nurturing a healthy environment for growth and respect.
      </p>
      <h4 class="margin-top-10">3. The Ability to Motivate</h4>
      <p>You can not lead a team that is not motivated to succeed. The ability to motivate a team is a beneficial skill leaders should have as it pushes everyone to do their best, making everything more fun and everyone more engaged. 
      </p>
      <h4 class="margin-top-10">4. The Ability to Problem-Solve</h4>
      <p>Problems and obstacles can commonly occur within group work. A leader needs to know how to effectively and efficiently navigate through those obstacles while utilizing the team's efforts to overcome them. Fundamentally, this allows the team to focus on getting the most done, increasing their chances of overall success. 
      </p>
      <h4 class="margin-top-10">5. Adaptation</h4>
      <p>A critical skill every leader should have is adapting to different situations. This skill enables leaders to identify opportunities and smoothly execute ideas. By embracing adaptability, leaders can efficiently navigate dynamic environments, allowing change to occur naturally.

      <h2>Activity Idea</h2>

<section>
    <div class="block">
      <p><span class="first-character atw">I</span>could teach other participants in the program how to build a blinking LED using Arduino. I believe this could be fun for others my age as it is an engaging, hands-on activity that utilizes some of the fundamentals of coding, which may be a new concept to some. If this activity is too     straightforward, I could make it more challenging and teach them how to increase the speed of the blinking LED depending on the distance of an object to an ultrasonic sensor.
